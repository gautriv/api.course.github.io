You’ve completed the **Beginner API documentation exercises—great job!**

Now, before we step into **intermediate-level API documentation**, let’s address some **important API concepts** that are often overlooked but **critical for writing high-quality documentation.**  

**Why this chapter?**  
APIs are more than just endpoints and responses. To truly **write developer-friendly documentation**, you need to understand:  
- **Rate Limits** – Prevent API abuse and ensure fair usage.  
- **Pagination** – Handle large datasets efficiently.  
- **Authentication & Security** – Secure API access using API keys, OAuth, and JWT.  
- **Webhooks** – Enable real-time updates instead of constant polling.  
- **Error Handling** – Help developers troubleshoot API issues effectively.  

## What you’ll learn?  
- Understand how APIs implement rate limits and best practices for documentation.  
- Explain pagination techniques like Offset-Limit and Cursor-based pagination.  
- Document authentication mechanisms like API Keys, OAuth, and JWT tokens.  
- Define webhooks and guide users on how to set them up securely.  
- Provide structured error messages that help developers debug API issues.  

These concepts will **set you apart** as an API documentation expert.  
Let’s bridge the gaps and get ready for the next level!
