You’ve done a fantastic job learning how to **structure and write API documentation** that is clear, concise, and developer-friendly. But let’s be honest—**the best way to learn is by doing.**  

This section is all about **getting your hands dirty with real API documentation challenges.**  

## What to Expect?  
Whether you're new to API documentation or looking to refine your skills, these exercises will help you **bridge the gap between theory and real-world scenarios.**  

**How It Works:**  
The chapter contains **5 hands-on exercises** that simulate **real-world API documentation tasks.**  

You’ll:  
- Get an API request (or part of it) and write the documentation.  
- Think through how to structure information clearly.
- Compare your response with a provided solution.

The goal? **Help you practice like you’re already working as an API technical writer.**  

## Let’s Start with the Basics!  
These beginner exercises will help you get comfortable with:  
- Understanding API requests & responses.  
- Documenting endpoints, parameters, and authentication.  
- Handling API errors and responses effectively.
