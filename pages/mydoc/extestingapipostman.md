You’ve **built and tested APIs with authentication, error handling, and logging**. Now, it’s time to **advance your skills with:**  

- JWT-based authentication for secure access  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for different user permissions  
- Database integration (SQLite) for persistent storage  
- Performance optimization with caching & rate limiting  

By the end of this section, you’ll have **production-level API features** used in real-world applications.
