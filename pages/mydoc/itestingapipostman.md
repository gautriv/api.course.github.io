You’ve already **built and tested a basic API** in the beginner section. Now, it’s time to **enhance it** with:  
- URL parameters & query strings to handle dynamic requests  
- Error handling & validation to prevent bad data  
- Authentication (API Key) to secure access  
- Logging API requests for debugging  

By the end of this section, you’ll have a **fully functional API** with **real-world features**, making it **more powerful and production-ready**.
