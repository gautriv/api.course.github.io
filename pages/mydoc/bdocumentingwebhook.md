You’ve learned how **webhooks work, how they differ from REST APIs, and how to document them effectively.** Now, it’s time to **put your skills to the test!**  

## What to expect in these exercises?  
Just like with **REST API documentation**, webhook documentation has **different levels of complexity**. These exercises will help you:  

- Understand real-world webhook use cases (Payments, E-commerce, and Notifications).  
- Write structured documentation covering webhook payloads, security, and error handling.  
- Tackle increasing levels of difficulty from **beginner to expert.**  

## How it works?  
The chapter contains **5 hands-on exercises** that simulate **real-world API documentation tasks.**  

These exercises **introduce you to basic webhook documentation.** You’ll start with **single events**, learn how to **structure webhook docs**, and gradually **move towards handling more complex scenarios.**
