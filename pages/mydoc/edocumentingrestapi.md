Congratulations on reaching the **Expert Level!**  

So far, you’ve built a **strong foundation** in API documentation. You’ve learned about **API structure, authentication, rate limits, pagination, error handling, and even mastered cURL.** Now, it’s time to **apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios** and **tackle complex API documentation challenges.**  

## What to Expect in the Expert-Level Exercises?
These exercises will challenge you to document **real-world APIs** with **advanced technical complexity.** Each challenge is designed to **simulate real job scenarios** where you’ll need to:  
- Write documentation for GraphQL, gRPC, API versioning, security, and performance.**  
- Think like an API technical writer working with developers.  
- Analyze incomplete documentation and fill in missing details.  
- Handle API deprecations, error management, and security concerns.  
- Write clear, structured, and professional API documentation.  

Each section contains an **exercise** and its **solution**—but before you peek at the solution, try to **document it yourself!**  

### Ready? Let’s Start the Expert-Level Challenges!

**Pro Tip:** In real-world API documentation, there are often **gaps in technical details**. If you find anything unclear in these exercises, **ask yourself: How would I clarify this for developers?**  

Once you've completed all **five expert-level exercises**, you'll have the skills to **document APIs at an industry-standard level.**
