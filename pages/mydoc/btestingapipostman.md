Now that you’ve **documented APIs**, it’s time to take a **hands-on approach** by **building and testing your own API**! In this section, you’ll learn how to:  
- Test an existing API using Postman  
- Develop a simple API using Python (Flask)  
- Test your API with Postman and understand requests & responses  
- Document the API you built  

These exercises will give you **real-world experience** with **API development and testing**, helping you **better understand the developer's perspective.**
